# Comic Book Converter

While exploring color eink and attempting to find a perfect tablet for reading digital comic books, I found a gap in utilities.

When playing around with Kobo Clara Colour, I noticed most of my CBR comic book files did not work on the device.

When I tried to convert the file to CBZ, it started working!

If I am running into this problem, it's possible that this is something someone else might want to do as well.

So here's the app!
